# Session abstract

Spring 5 is here! One of the most exciting introductions in this release is support for reactive programming, building on Project Reactor to support message-driven, elastic, resilient, and responsive services. Spring 5 integrates an MVC-like component model adapted to support reactive processing and a new type of web endpoint: functional reactive endpoints. This session dives into the net-new Netty-based web runtime and shows how to integrate it with existing Spring-stack technologies and leverage powerful new testing mechanisms to make code better and life easier, and it ties it all together with a live coding demo. If there's more to your life than CRUD, you need to be there.
