The first days of October 2017 the JTech CodeSmiths have visited the JavaOne conference, part of the gigantic Oracle Open World conference, held in San Francisco.
Over all it was a well-organised event, except for one aspect: coffee. Oh, and the wifi tended to be flakey too.

It turned out that at the Moscone conference centre, coffee was a scarse article. Sure, there was a Starbucks just around the corner.
But for a conference where tickets cost a couple hundred dollars per day you'd expect that a few cups of coffee per day is included.
And there _was_ a coffee stand indeed, outside on the Moscone Square, inbetween the Moscone North and Moscone West conference halls. 
You just had to exit the big hall and cross the street.

It was on the second day, a talk had finished at 12:30 and the next would start at 12:45. 
So in that 15 minute break I figured I could get a cup of coffee outside on the Moscone Square.

The people responsible for the coffee stand were very busy rearranging their stuff. 
I asked weather I could have some coffee, but one of them told me that was impossible. 
They were swapping their morning setup for the afternoon setup, so from 12:00 to 13:00 they were essentially closed.

So what to do then. I recalled from the day before that just one or two blocks away there was a nice local coffee bar, and I wanted to pay them a visit again.
I walked two blocks away from the Moscone Centre, but did't see any coffee bar. 
After three blocks I became aware that apparently I had walked into the wrong direction.
So I thought, better continue for a block or so. And indeed, I saw a Subway at the corner.
I rather had visited a local venue instead of a worldwide franchise chain, but this had to do.
So inside I went, and saw above the counter that one cup of coffee costed two dollar something.
Nice, because at Starbucks it would cost three dollar something.

Beside the counter a homeless lady addressed me, and asked me weather I could spare a dollar.
So I replied:

> I have just spared me a dollar by going here instead of Starbucks.
> And I'm in a good mood today, so you can have that dollar.

She was very grateful for the dollar I gave her. I got in cue to order.
The lady behind the counter had noticed my good deed, but had some bad news for me.
Because it turned out they only served coffee until 12:00.

Now the question that popped up in me was about the previous transaction with the homeless lady:

> Should that transaction be commited or rolled back?

I had to walk back three blocks again, go around the corner of the Moscone conference centre, walk another block and get in queue at the Starbucks, wait for ten minutes, then I _finally_ had my coffee.
But it had taken fourty minutes to get it. Some bad luck. I was late for the next talk, but as it turned out I hadn't missed that much.

So the next conference I'll visit, I will be wearing this neat TShirt
