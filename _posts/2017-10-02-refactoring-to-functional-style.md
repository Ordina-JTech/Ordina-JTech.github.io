# Session abstract

In Java we've programmed with the imperative style for a few decades now. With Java 8, we can also code in functional style, which has several benefits: concise code that's more expressive, easier to understand, and easier to change. But the transition from imperative to functional style is a hard journey. It's not as much an issue of getting comfortable with the syntax--it's the challenge of thinking functionally. What better way to learn that transition than taking imperative code and refactoring it to a more functional style. This presentation starts with multiple code examples written in imperative style and shows how to approach refactoring them to functional style.
