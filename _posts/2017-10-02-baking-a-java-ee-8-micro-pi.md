# Session abstract

Microservices are already a popular architecture for new applications, particularly with the modern need for applications to be cloud-native and light enough for the Internet of Things. One of the key challenges of breaking up monoliths into microservices is orchestration. This tutorial looks at some of the brand-new features and APIs in Java EE 8 that can help and presents an interactive Raspberry Pi-based demo that shows how easily messaging can be made cloud-ready with JCA connectors.

# My Notes

So my first talk of the day and of JavaOne. Iâ€™m curious. Itâ€™s a small crowd here.  But hidden gems are sometimes found.  Something is going wrong. No screen and stuff am about to walk out. Will give it 5 more minutes. 
He is started but de demo heavyness has been cancelled I think because of connection problems.

## How lightweight is java EE, really?
###  Recent history...

* 2013
	* docker was a baby
	* Wildfly was still JBoss AS (no swarm)
	* before spring boot
	* no websphere liberty profile
* 2017
	* docker is now the dominant container format
	* WildFly have fully product-ized Swarm
	* Spring boot have now been making jars not wars for a few years now 
	* IBM released Open Liberty 
	* Payara entered the fray and released Payara Micro
	* Eclipse MicroProfile is established and progressing

## Whatâ€™s in java EE today?
