# Session abstract

Java EE (6/7/8) applications are lean and self-contained--no external dependencies required. Is it possible to apply the same design principles to building web applications? In this session, the presenter codes an HTML5 single-page application "from scratch," relying just on web standards without any external dependencies. REST, WebSocket communication with a Java EE back end, data binding, and styling are included. Audience questions are highly appeciated.

Fantasic talk and very convincing story for just using standard components.
