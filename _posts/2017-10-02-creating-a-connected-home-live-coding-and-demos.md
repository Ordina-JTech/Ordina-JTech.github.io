# Session abstract

Wouldn't you love to be able to walk into a room and use your phone or voice to turn on your lights? When you are relaxing on the couch, listening to music, wouldn't it be nice to just talk to your speaker to turn up the volume or change the song? Can you imagine being able to turn on the fan by just saying you are hot? In this session, Java Champion and four-time JavaOne Rock Star Kevin Nilson and his 12-year-old son, Andy, do a live-coding demo of creating a connected home.
