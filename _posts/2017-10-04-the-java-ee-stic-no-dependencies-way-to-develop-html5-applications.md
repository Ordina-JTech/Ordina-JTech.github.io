# Session abstract

Java EE (6/7/8) applications are lean and self-contained--no external dependencies required. Is it possible to apply the same design principles to building web applications? In this session, the presenter codes an HTML5 single-page application "from scratch," relying just on web standards without any external dependencies. REST, WebSocket communication with a Java EE back end, data binding, and styling are included. Audience questions are highly appeciated.

What should you do is learn the specks. 
E.g. Use nav element because of screen readers
