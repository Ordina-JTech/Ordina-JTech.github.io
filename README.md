## You can add a blog post
Blog posts are just markdown documents, so anyone can write them!

1. Clone this repository
1. Create a new markdown file in folder `/_posts` with the format `yyyy-mm-dd-YOUR-TITLE`
1. First-timers: add yourself as an author to `/_data/authors.yml`
1. Commit & Push!

GitHub will automagically refresh the site content within a few minutes.
Maybe you need to clear your browser's cache.

## You can make bigger changes than just add a blog
But don't apply changes without seeing they work for yourself.

### Setup

Make sure you have Ruby 2.0 or higher installed.
Run `sudo gem install jekyll bundler` and `bundle install`

### Running

Run the following: `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
Go to the url `http://localhost:4000/`

The commands above assume a non-windows development environment.
